Today, the village is abuzz with excitement; the annual Festival of the Emerald Leaves is about to commence. This festival celebrates the onset of autumn and is a time when druids from neighboring regions gather to exchange knowledge and partake in ancient rituals.

**Amidst the backdrop of the Festival of the Emerald Leaves in StrafenFallVilage, a new figure walks into the elven enclave...**

You play as Drufen, a skilled human hunter, who steps through the mystical barriers, that shield the village from the outside world. Though the festival is a spectacle to behold, Drufen has little time for celebration. He's on a mission to find the best rum for King Miradas, a monarch from a neighboring human kingdom, and to deliver a concealed message to High Druid Elira Moonshade.

### Drufen's Entry

As Drufen enters the village, he's immediately captivated by its ethereal beauty. The moonlight dances on the surface of the Whispering Waterfalls, and magical lanterns float through the air, illuminating the ancient trees. But Drufen is a man of focus; he shakes off the allure of the surroundings and proceeds toward the village square, where a grand market is set up for the festival.
Stalls are abundant with exotic herbs, magical artifacts, and enchanted clothing. However, his eyes are set on a particular tent at the far end, adorned with various bottles and casksâ€”this must be where the famed elven rum is sold.

### The Rum and the Message ..!

Finding the rum is only half the battle. Drufen also bears a sealed letter from King Miradas, a message meant for the eyes of High Druid Elira Moonshade. The contents of the message are unknown to him, but the wax seal of the king's sigil suggests its importance.
