ok So i just thought of it but i think it would be better to have people to beceom their own freind and have a personal chatroom in the begining of the app.

ok so now i will write about the updated contract and a few ideas reagrding the same.
So for today the Aim is to hit a clear 8 hours of work so that we may be able to execute on the plan as quickly as possible and as much as possible. Lets not try to idle and build out the whole thing as quickly as possible.

For the reference of the project let us Use
Simple Chat backend for doing authentication using Google Firebase
then we need a landing

things to be done for the day today: WIll have to work till 12 pm almost 100 pc
Similarly will have to figure out and update the contract.
IDea is to make the most progress as much as possible

Full project:

1. Website
   - landing age with Svelte ( make it look good - for a product launch)
     - get Either MidJourney or Stable Diffusion or some other subscripton for images ? >> or use already existing Images for landing page
     - make the design for landing page
     - copy the design from My own Home page with the Nav Bar
     - basic copy writing for the page should ALso be done.
   - Maintain stats of all heros etc
2. Backend logic

   - we need to make a similar logic to that of our other game. ( The big question is should we use MongoDB or firebase ? )
   - maybe for now we could use Firebase ??? casue the thing has to modify the Schema or maybe we could use MongoDB itself ?
   - or we could use a simple JSON server in that case instead right ?
   - Ok lets leave Authentication on MOngo DB for now and just go instead with MongoDB itself
   - Ok another question, do we use a NoSQL Databse for this or a SQL DB for this ?
   - ok so an architecture i want to download textual data
   -

3. Authntication
4. App
   - Learn React native - Code- evolution
   - On th

thing si want to do :
Ok so what i want to do is that i want to first login , and then i want to send that data

ok so what inform
ok
anothet thign i want to do is to be able to

ok so i noticed somethign interesting here :

https://www.reddit.com/r/paymentgatewayinindia/
seems like a nice thread to join and explore , also being one of the first people to actually use it , would be afun experience , plus i dont want to be a mod so it might be fun to join in and see when i am integrating payments , and paying to the whole app.

ok have decided to just stick with firebase for now and using some amount of JSOn wrangling or Index DB or local storage for all the content. So the next part to look at is to quickly ship something today itself

so the idea is to basically iuse FFHV1 as the basic Design Language for the app and build it accoridngy

so the rpg-2 is very similar to the hero slection and inventory selection part of the webapp
mak
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pgstudio.heroadventure&hl=en_US
this also intersting
so fo rnow lets generate hero image

ok so the other thing is to have a nice place
ok so i ahve abunch of good candidates now
today will extensively work on the design of the app
maybe we should use figma for this

still genertaing stuff for inspiration

maybe we should try anime sorta stuff ,
basically have the charatcer in the background a simple sentence or two / call to action and thne based on that we should build the whole app
the logo could be simpler and could bemore along the lines with luck and the 20 faced dice
basically thr RNG stats must also be taken into consideration
that means we barely have 18 misn to do naythign else whch is very bad and dangerous

so i am aminly spending very large amounts of time jsut figuring ot the log and stuff of the whole thing
ok wait lets first get back on track before we end up wasting too much of time.
We need to do authentication as well. We might as well lean into Firebase complely for now and just build like crazy.
basically we can ignore realtimeDb and Just use Firestore and the other content sotrage facilties as much as possible.
ALso will have to estbalish a company soon to be able to make a payment gateway and be able to accept money.

another idea is to build some sort of atool that could be useful to people , and enterprises liek remove bg or some sort of very often used APi

ANother super super crazy Idea is to basically give people a presnetaiton or PDF or a doc in full given a simple API call.
Basically to build a human API. I really really want to experience that once. Especially the stuff similar to scale ai.
basically APi based consultation for somethong or something like that.

SO i will first downlaod some inspirational images quickly

ok awesome , so now i have downloaded a few images , i liked a few cocnepts of the app . But i am not sure how close the concepts would be if the apps that they use will be paid etc ,
COol so lets jsut go with it , this stuff influences and makes me thin

k of the web3 things that could be sold along with the loot project

So was thinking of integrating an NFT oike game witrh
Alright finalllyyy we are getting some time but barely enough 6pm + 6 hours ~ 12:00 //

// things to do involve making the image a background
// generating content for the app
// use chatgpt for ascertianign if it can act as an RPG partner.
// how to mkae an image the backgorund for your website
https://github.com/biomejs/biome
was stuck on this and this sems interesting.

// get the basic authentication working
// get the basic chat as well working
// get the basic
// creation of a semi linear story that exists, plus
//
// maybe also add teh CSS to make the website mobile compatible/ with reactive elements.
// basically firstly just finish the whole app
man am i even so desperate to make some money as quickly as possible , gawwd pls help lol, lemme just finish this as quickly
i also want to add some more effects to it
ok we also need to buy a domain name - like try-the-rpg.co or somethign along those lines and ship it by tonight itself as much as possible.
Instead of complicating the whole thing , just focus on a single story to build something
Lets actually launch this so that I Can put it into Y-Combinator. on 13th
this would mean a launch on so its on october 13th 2023 --> ( that means we just have 4 days left to execute the whole thing )
// remove all non esstential things and launch very quickly right now asap.
4 days means - saturday 8 am meaning by friday 8 pm the app should be releaseable , plus a soft launch on rediit , product hunt, make a simpel Disocrd server and get feedback as quickly as possible.
basically buy a domain name and build out the whole app. SO finish building the app by tomorrow so that you can gather feedback.
payment integration can be done later as well
also to add this into the Group.

most important things

// make landing page
// make simple app landing
// write the code for the backend of the app with the prompts to and the stats and the dice roll mechanisms
// 63 faced uneven dices as well to put it in to prespective.
// i am desperate to release a product and get rapid feedback

https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/JKL-magic-loops-easy-automation-with-ai
if only the computer could take control of a virtual desktop

- this idea seems os much better

another part of the chatting idea is to help become a dungeon master for other people do that they enjoy
so Basically a human on the other end adds stuff to the Ai prompt so that it can help the other

i think magic loops with avirtualized desktop will be just OP
So a virtual desktop could be a game changer for building and doign things that i have onlyimagined
am going over amazon work stations quickly

alright so we are at 4 hours of time yohoo , 4 more hours to go goodnesss gracious
should i jump into the Ai video trend , i think not

what sort of game is baldurs gate

ok before naythign lets try and build out the system with which we can be sure that gpt-3 builds out a consistent RPG ?

so gpt will need to keep extracting data from each of the
basically i want ot make it a story weaver with a semi persitent world ,

so the question is , if it is even possible to have a consistent location based and time based calculation in the present universe that currently exists

dudeee , but now the big question is can i execute client side Javascript code that is returned from chat gpt ?

so now the other question in my mind is how do we initiate the dice roll in between the prompt so that chatGPT first stops then executes the code
so if i want o make ti as simple aspossible i will ahve to
so do we need the accomplice dungeon master for now ?
basically you have a current character that you want to take and want to

let ssee if thers a API release

10 per 1000 credits
500 images = 10 usd

ok so instead of using a scalable approach like that

ok so the thinfs to do for tomorrow is to be abe to
ok so another part is that i am sort of influenced by RAG and

so now i am contemplating a lot lot lot

so how to convert base64 to image
hmm this will be an interesting project to execute especially first on web and then on app. Itll def be a fun experiecne

lets instead make a persistent world with writng and episodes and events and random quests and more.
I think have one mega persistent world might be more interesting , something like a multi User dungeon itself.
Or the other way is to build it like how i would build Genshin imapct where there are a very many characters and so on .
It might be fun to make a GAcha game with this as well.
So you want to sell virtual items in a persistent world or do you want to let people create their own stories and so on.
Maybe we can add a cost to build a world like 100 usd to Build your world and another 100 usd to make it private.( i.e onyl invite mode).
ahhah so even ai dungeon does a lot of prompt tuning
https://help.aidungeon.com/faq/all-about-world-info

so basically they too hve not created a persistent world , but what if you could influence other players experiences of the world around you. A truly multiplayer experience perhaps ??

32k
words
ok so i can definitely use Dream studio to generate images and make the whole website better than it currently is.
The other thing I can do is to also use
So the thing is you want to create a semi persistenet world as you go around.
man
having a single JSON for the whole world will actually be simpler.
and it will be simpler if chat gpt can genertae the JSON such that it is then put inside the databse. SO the next time someone traverses over the same path it will be super cool.

looks super cool stuff - animeish

was fairness alway sconsidered
so a single consitent persistent world , all tied together using some sort of lack lusture RAG.
ok so basically ocnverting base-64 to the other format iste maost major thug we ought ot do

ok so lets start executing

// finish the main landing page web oly version
// go to login page , if not logged - stay there and ask to login else
// go to the

ok so there are quite a few hiccups in the dice roll functionality.

this probably means that currently havibg an LLM recalculate stats might not be the best thing.

have decided to add proper rules for accessing the Firebase thing.

---

so for today we have a lot of thibgs to do

so i requisitioned some time to check out the other apps. I still feel they are at a local minima.
A persisitent world is indeed very interesting

so the basic thing is for the gameplay to be good m i beleiv there probably needs to be some sort of a persistent universe in some-way or the other

ok i have a few questions

ok so spending exeedignly large amounts o tie on reddit, soeculating on what type of game i should be amign

ok so i came across a thread on reddit on a bunch of Saas products each of which have got a very high qcquisition and are very profitbale. They are basically perfect for me to try to ape or mime in a way . But i got to learn from their successes or failures as well.

so i am also convinced on a quite s few thing sushas right now

so teh r/Sass has a lot of cool things in them
, ok but its onyl specirc post s
https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/16hn1yc/making_11000_every_month_running_a_simple_saas/

I want to make a game called "building filled with spirits"
where cute and cuddly spirits exists in the drawn landscape

ok so we are bascially 2 hours behind ,we got a lot of information and understnadng. My prediction is , if we can even run an Image generation pipeline for whatevre reason we should be able to make money someway.

But i seriously think i want to become some sort of a game dev first

// ok for implementing a skateboard prototype ,
we need to finsh off authentication first

SO basically we want to position ourselves in the right way to make money
Would it be possible to build an Indie Game Studio in India that oo profitably and grow it quickly as well and then pivot into graphics cards and actual hardware and treu web3 with proof o compute. For this the games i release need to work well in the market.

hmmmm so electricity got cut of at 4:23 lets hope that this works with the
maybe we should buy a small UPS of Anker or something i am thinkingn -- will chcek out the a
ok the internet still seems to not be working. Also i just relaized that i might not be able to test the fetaures for/ with forebase or even OpenAI as they are not online. Will need the internet to be able to do the changes.

lets get a good design on the Signup/ Login page and some more information , -- this we will do in the end
Another question how do i qualify for epic free games ?

lots of stupid fun , but just bought into realkty liek how fall guys was an analog of takeshis castle

i mean imagine making an Android alternative with just 10 percent fees or lesser
basically drive these monopolies to Zero with

appleand google as the giants in the hosue bring in over a nillion USD.

tik tok made meplay it
aslo the one belwo

so the basic architecture without any backend for making the game playbale right now will be to just

ok for now igore the login error we will solve it via cookies

# For tomorrow:

wake up by 7:00 am max preferable 6:30 ish done ready by 7:30 am

### Assuming that a persistent Database will take time to build lets first just build out thebasic version without the RAG for the launch for now.

~~Make data structure for storing Chat~~
~~retrieve the last 400 messages max using firestore and store it in a IndexDB and populate it~~
~~Finish making the openAI call from the chat -i.e server API~~
The client JS files will be responsible for remixing the current data ( this time with pour rag) - JS file to arrange the prompt and send to API

- Make simple architecture for making the prompts and Sending them across - ~~System prompt~~ - two tone architecture One for Hero stats One for Hero Inventory and One for the actual text actions
  ~~Make random Dice function in client JS ( 26 or 20 role dice) file for it to work~~
  ~~Wtite and test the prompts~~
  ~~Function to Trim the history of chat within a limit~~
  ~~add relevant context to the begining and end of chat~~
  Experiment the final OpenAI call is sent to the Backend
  Test the infinite scroll properly

<!-- Think of the data structure --> Not needed for now

post the above in prod

Make the figma Design for the app quickly - simple and easy
Then quickly choose the basic visuals of the app and add them to the different screens
Update the design of the app for desktop

post the above in prod

Now change up the Design of the Chat Messages and focus on the UI
start writing media Queries for it to fit on Phone/mobile

post the above in prod

experiment with the markdown rendering after
experimetn with caching the data or storing them in cookies so as to reduce calls to firestore

post the above in prod

plan a quick hero upgrade system and bring in heros and images from stabel DiffusinXL - not needed for now

## Lets not comment anything else till the app is functioning atleast at some basic level.
