# App name : the AI pod

Intro: This is basically a game app for a group of friends to use as a chat app to swipe on potential AI agentic friends as well as talk to them. The AI agents take decisons based on other peoples actions and themselves decide how they want the game to progress.

## initial vision:

a love and swiping game, where you build up on affection between different AI agents and as you progress you increase the love parameter with them. eventually at the end of the 3 day period the user with the most love points/ currently exisiting Love points wins and the perosn can continue. Each game is played in pods , where there are 3 Users and 5-6 Agents. Each of the agents then decide and derieve information from each of the other players.

For the above requirement we will need to understand how to write backend code and host the backend code to be able to run the whole system

Another fun little idea that i have is, that i want a space or a home lab to test out different backend infrastructures nd test them.

Toned Down/ pared down vision:
The game instead of taking place for 3 days will now take place for 1 hour. Your interactions with the agents will reveal more information of what we need to do.

Challenges:
giving agents long term memeory , strategic thinking , goals and situations. Nested LLMs to feel and do things.

Objectives from the Project:

1. make sure to learn some backedn technology stack so that i can apply it quickly --> so instead for this will do a simpler project first and then go do the other one ( this will be a public project that i will make )

toned down vision of the gae to be finished in 3 days from now by Monday / Tuesday Night based on if I do sub project for learnign backend before this:

So the other super cool thought I had was , WOuldnt it be cool if I COuld buy my own server and set it up quickly and use it as my experiemntal ground

---

## initial visionv2:

we have now quickly pivoted to become an asynchronous datbase managament LLM , a compeltly new type of interaction.
basically what i mean to say is that we have now become an asynchronous MUD for LLM larpers etc. Its a multiplayer AI RPG experiment currently. It s also completly asynchronous.
